# GameOfChess
Hey there.
Welcome to one of my semester break projects, the GameOfChess.
I've been into playing a bit of chess recently, all thanks to a good friend of mine. 
Hope you guys enjoy it too.

Disclaimer:
This game is single player (no AI, no opponent bots, and ye, no multiplayer)

Have fun trying it out :)
